### Notes:
- Replace placeholders (like `username`, `repository-name`, `your.email@example.com`, etc.) with your actual information.
- Tailor the sections to match the specifics of your project, such as the installation steps or usage instructions.
- Add or remove sections based on the complexity and requirements of your project. 

Feel free to modify the template as needed!
